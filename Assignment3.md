### **Assignment 3: Working with Forms and Events**
Focus on form handling, event listeners, and two-way binding.

1. **Explain how forms are handled in React. Why do we use controlled components?**  
2. **Create a login form with two inputs: "Username" and "Password." Handle the form submission and log the input values to the console.**  
3. **What is two-way binding in React? Demonstrate it with an example.**  
4. **Add validation to the above form: Display an error message if either field is empty when the form is submitted.**  
5. **What is the significance of the `onChange` event in React forms? Modify the login form to display the live input values below the form.**  
6. **Build a feedback form with a textarea, a dropdown (for rating), and a submit button. On submission, display the entered feedback in a card below the form.**
