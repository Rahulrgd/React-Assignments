### **Assignment 6: State Management and Advanced React Concepts**

**Objective**: Master global state management and advanced hooks.

1. **Project 1: Shopping Cart with Redux**  
   Build a shopping cart application with Redux for state management.  
   - **Features**: Add, update, and remove items in the cart.  
   - Display the cart's total price and the total number of items.  
   - Use Redux for global state management and persist cart data in `localStorage`.

2. **Project 2: Task Manager with Context API**  
   Create a task manager app with the following features:  
   - Add, edit, and delete tasks.  
   - Use the Context API for global state.  
   - Group tasks by categories (e.g., Work, Personal, etc.) and allow filtering tasks by category.

3. **Project 3: Infinite Scroll App**  
   - Fetch and display data (e.g., images from Unsplash API) in a grid layout.  
   - Implement infinite scrolling so more items load as the user scrolls down.  
   - Use `useEffect` to fetch data and manage the state with `useState`.

4. **Project 4: Drag and Drop Todo List**  
   - Use `react-beautiful-dnd` or a similar library to implement a drag-and-drop feature in a to-do list.  
   - Allow users to reorder tasks by dragging and dropping them.

5. **Project 5: Real-Time Chat App**  
   - Simulate a chat app where messages are sent/received in real-time.  
   - Use `useReducer` for managing message state.  
   - Add typing indicators and message timestamps.
