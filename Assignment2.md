### **Assignment 2: Advanced React Components**
Deepen understanding of lists, keys, conditional rendering, and lifecycle methods.

1. **Explain the importance of keys in React lists. Create a component that displays a list of fruits dynamically using the `map()` method.**  
2. **What is conditional rendering in React? Create a component that conditionally displays a message based on a boolean state value.**  
3. **What are React fragments? Rewrite the following component using fragments:**
   ```jsx
   <div>
       <h1>Title</h1>
       <p>Description</p>
   </div>
   ```
4. **Create a React app that displays a list of books. Add a delete button next to each book to remove it from the list.**  
5. **Explain React component lifecycle. Why are lifecycle methods important in class components? Provide an example of `componentDidMount`.**  
6. **Use React state to toggle between "Light Mode" and "Dark Mode" in a basic application.**
