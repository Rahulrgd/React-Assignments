3. **Create a "ThemeContext" and use it to toggle between Light Mode and Dark Mode in the application.**  
4. **How do `useContext` and `Context.Provider` work together? Provide an example.**  
5. **Modify the blog app created in Assignment 4 to store the list of blog posts in Context. Access and display the list using `useContext`.**
