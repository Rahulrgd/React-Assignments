### **Assignment 4: React Router**
Teach navigation and routing using `react-router-dom`.

1. **What is React Router? Why do we use it?**  
2. **Set up routing in a React app using `react-router-dom`. Create three pages: "Home," "About," and "Contact," and enable navigation between them.**  
3. **Explain the difference between `BrowserRouter` and `HashRouter`. Which one would you use for a modern React application?**  
4. **What is the `useParams` hook? Create a blog app with a list of blog posts. Clicking on a blog post opens a new page with details, using dynamic routing.**  
5. **What is the purpose of the `useNavigate` hook? Add a button to redirect users to the "Contact" page when clicked.**  
6. **Create a "Not Found" page and set up routing so that any invalid URL redirects to this page.**
