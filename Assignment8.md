### **Assignment 8: Advanced Topics and Optimizations**
Focus on performance optimizations, custom hooks, and deployment.

1. **What are React hooks? Create a custom hook to fetch data from an API and reuse it across components.**  
2. **Explain memoization in React. Use `React.memo` to optimize a list-rendering component in your app.**  
3. **What is code splitting in React? Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to load components lazily in your app.**  
4. **Deploy a React application to Vercel or Netlify. Provide the deployment link in your submission.**  
5. **Explain the difference between client-side rendering and server-side rendering in React. When would you use each?**  
6. **Build a small e-commerce app with the following:**
   - A product listing page (with data fetched from an API).  
   - A cart page to add/remove products.  
   - Use Context API or a state management library like Redux to manage the cart state.
