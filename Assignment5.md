### **Assignment 5: Using Axios for API Calls**
Introduce fetching data with Axios and handling API responses.

1. **What is Axios, and why is it preferred over the Fetch API?**  
2. **Set up Axios in a React app and fetch data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder). Display the fetched data in a table format.**  
3. **Explain how to handle errors in Axios. Modify the above app to display an error message if the API call fails.**  
4. **Create a button to fetch posts from the API and display them dynamically. Add a loading spinner while the data is being fetched.**  
5. **What is the difference between `GET` and `POST` requests in Axios? Create a form to add a new post to the API using a `POST` request. Log the API response.**  
6. **Explain the importance of cleanup in API calls. Use the `useEffect` hook to fetch data and implement cleanup to avoid memory leaks.**
