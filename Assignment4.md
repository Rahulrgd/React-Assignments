### **Assignment 4: React Hooks**

**Objective**: Practice React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, etc.).

1. **Project 1: Weather App**  
   - Fetch weather data from an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).  
   - Display the current temperature, weather condition, and location.  
   - Allow the user to search for weather by city name.

2. **Project 2: Expense Tracker**  
   Build an expense tracker app with the following features:  
   - Add expenses with a description, amount, and date.  
   - Display the total expenses.  
   - Use `useState` for managing expenses and `useEffect` to store/retrieve expenses from local storage.

3. **Project 3: Theme Context**  
   Create a React app with a theme toggle using `useContext`.  
   - Use a context provider to store the current theme (light/dark).  
   - Apply the theme across all components in the app.

4. **Project 4: Search and Filter App**  
   - Create an app to display a list of items (e.g., movies, books).  
   - Add a search bar to filter the list dynamically as the user types.  
   - Fetch the data from a public API like [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://developers.themoviedb.org/).
